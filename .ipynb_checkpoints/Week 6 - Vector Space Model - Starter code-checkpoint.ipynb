    "Because the axes aren't labeled it is hard to interpret this graph. But my best guess is that the x-axis represents one word's values and the y-axis represents another word. The values of these two variables are not comparable because they are different scales. Is moving from 0 to 1 on the x axis akin to moving from 0 to 1000 on the y axis? Do we want to represent the variation in terms of standard deviations instead o the units of measure? If so, we should standardize them. If they are substantively meaningfully different scales though I don't think you want to normalize/standardize them. But since we want to more easily compare them and as stated bewlow it's common practice, we are going to do it."

We're also reducing the amount of information contained in the vector, so we only look at the one parameter (angle) instead of comparing them on two parameters. As the description above describes, this is done on a vector-by-vector basis, not like other transformationt that may standardize a variable based on the entire sample.
